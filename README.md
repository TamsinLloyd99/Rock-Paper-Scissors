# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A rock paper scissors game made with javascript

This was part of an in-class activity set while beginning to learn Javascript. 
The coding pushed me to research new javascript language and put terms I already knew into practice. 
The code should generate a ten-round game against the computer and log user input to determine who wins after the ten rounds.
Through this activity, I learned how to make for loops and how to use switch commands to determine responses to certain outcomes. I also learned how to generate random numbers/strings by using Maths commands.
